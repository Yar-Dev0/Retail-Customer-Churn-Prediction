Task 1:

Task is to find a classification dataset online (e.g. Kaggle, Dataworld, Google Dataset Search)
which should contain a variety of the features of following type: Ordinal, Nominal, Binary, Discrete,
and Continuous. Then perform the following operations:

1. Data Analysis: Identify the attribute type of every feature in your dataset (Ordinal, Nominal, etc.)
and justify which preprocessing you will choose on every feature and why?
2. Data Visualization: Load the data into a pandas data frame and perform Exploratory Data
Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib or Seaborn. Make sure your visualizations are meaningful and
write down any key insights you noticed from these visualizations.
3. Data Cleaning: Handle the missing data in the data frame’s numeric columns using techniques
such as mean, medium, imputation, Smooth noise, identify/remove outliers etc., and visually
compare the results between them. Which one do you think is better and why?
4. Data Transformation: Apply various data transformation techniques as discussed in lecture
slides and the helping material on your dataset.
5. Classification: Perform classification on your original and pre-processed dataset using the
following ML Algorithms: KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree
6. Evaluation: You have to evaluate your model or train your model and show the results on
unclean/unprocessed dataset as well as processed dataset of all of your models using the Confusion
Matrix Display and Classification Report for every model trained
7. You must compile a report that should comprise of your selected problem, dataset description
and the preprocessing steps you follow along with their proper justification. Also show the
evaluation results before and after preprocessing steps.


Task 2:

In Today’s time, there is a intense competition in retail industry in understanding their customers better, especially their most profitable customer groups and the groups that have the biggest potential to become such and how to retain these groups.

Retail data is growing exponentially in variety, volume, velocity & value with each passing year. Smart retailers understand this data can be utilized and eventually holds the prospective for profit. As a result, these retailers are becoming more conscious about utilization of data and information kept in their repositories, so they can integrate and analyze these large volumes of data to come up with results that can support the quality of their decision making, in order to stay at a competitive advantage and to increase profits.

In this Competition, you must address the issue of churn prediction and customer retention in retail industry. This would not help the retailers to plan out retention strategies for their most profitable group of customers but to also design effective marketing programs for the future. In this way companies can retain their valued customers and can also make cost effective marketing strategies which are solely targeted to right customer base.

Consumer churn occurs when a buyer discontinues his or her dealings with an organization. In retail, a buyer is considered as churned once his/her last transaction outdates a particular amount of time. Once a profitable consumer becomes a churn, the loss experienced by the organization is not just the lost profits but also the cost which would be required to make new marketing plans and strategies to attract a new customer base.


Task 2.1:
• Preprocess the dataset and make a feature set (provided above).
• Label the customer as churn/Not-churn?
• Make a model for churn prediction, i.e., provided customers in test data will churn or
not?
A customer will churn if he/she has no visit in a week.



Task 2.2 EDA:
• Calculate the week with the highest earning?
• Identify the most valued customer?
• Categorize the customers into 3 groups (i.e., Poor, Mediocre, Rich)
• Will we able to figure out churn important factors from available data?
• How Churn Rate changes with Historical Visits? Answer this query with the help of
graph?
